# laravel5-sublime-snippets
Sublime text2 snippets for Laravel5. This is a work in progress and you can expect frequent changes.
I'm planning to include snippets for:
- Eloquent
- Forms
- Models
- other repetitive tasks for Laravel5.

Usage:
- Clone this repo to Sublime Text2/Packages/User
- Trigger: l5 + TAB
